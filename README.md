# Wordpress application

This project was made with [symfony 6](https://symfony.com/releases/6.0).

The app was written by me. It is used to add videos.  It has simplified authorization and authentication. Without logging in, we can browse videos. after logging in, we have the ability to add, delete or edit a video. In the application I used symfony-skeleton, doctrine, tailwindcss, symfony/webpack-encore and twig. The application is very basic and undeveloped. For this moment I posted its most basic version which you can see [here](http://deniii.ct8.pl/). You can check its functionality by logging in with Login: **`admin@gmail.com`** and Password: **`admin1234`** or register new account (without verification).I am already working on its expansion and for now I am posting what I have. 
As for its basic characteristics, it looks like this:
## Frontend
I used view templates (twig), and as for css styles, I used tailwindcss.
## Backend
The project was created using symfony/skeleton. For this I installed other packages like symfony/form, and doctrine. It stores data using SQL and migration.
## In the future
I am trying to implement more novelties, like a contact form, categories for videos, ratings or more bookmarks.
